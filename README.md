# Interaction-in-Virtual-Environments

### Repository 1: Autonomous Driving Agent

**Description:** A project exploring **Reinforcement Learning** to train an autonomous driving agent. The agent learns to master vehicle physics and navigate procedurally generated tracks using the **PPO** algorithm and the **Unity ML-Agents** library. The project also incorporates **Imitation Learning** to provide an initial knowledge base.

### Repository 2: Gesture-Controlled Game

**Description:** A simplified version of the Minecraft game where interaction is done entirely through gestures. The project uses a computer vision architecture with **Python**, **MediaPipe** and **Unity** to detect 21 key points on the hand in 3D, sending the data to **Unity** via a **UDP** network. The game features a procedurally generated world with caves, and the gesture system allows for actions such as moving, looking, destroying, and placing blocks.
